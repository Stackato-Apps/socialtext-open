Japanese fonts are not distributed with Socialtext, but can be manually set up
using the following script:

  nlw/dev-bin/fetch-japanese-fonts

This script will download the fonts and extract them into the correct place.
You should do this before install, and then everything should work.


The fonts will be fetched from a Socialtext server, and after running the script
you will see additional fonts in:

  nlw/share/fonts
