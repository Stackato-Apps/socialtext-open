This (etc/socialtext/stax) directory is where you configure certain
hacks to be applied to certain workspaces (on certain pages, under
certain conditions).

For instance, to apply the hack called "doofle" to the "dumbstruck"
workspace, for pages tagged "Diesel", make a file called dumbstruck.yaml
with the following contents:

    ---
    - hack: doofle
      tags:
        - Diesel

This will cause `doofle/stax.js` to be loaded on the appropriate pages.

The YAML file should contain an array of hack configs to be applied to
that workspace. Each config hash the following parameters:

* hack (required) - Name of hack. Used in path to find js file.
* action (optional string or array, default is '*') Page action where hack is activated.
* tag (optional string or array) Page must contain tag to activate hack.
* tag-match (optional regexp) One tag must match regexp.
* params (optional string) Information to pass to the hack

Example:

    ---
    - hack: foo
      action: display
      tag:
        - XXX
        - YYY
      params: qwertyuiop
    - hack: bar
      tag-match: '^Bar:?\s'

NOTE: tag and tag-match are mutually exclusive per config section. Use
      one or the other or neither (but not both).
