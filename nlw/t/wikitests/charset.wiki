| *Comment* | Set up the environment | .     |

| Comment    | traditional user settings screen       | .                  |

We moved this to the ST::Pluggable::Adapter::handler and it broke:

| Comment    | workspace-less user settings screen | .                  |
| get        | /?action=users_settings             |                    |
| code-is    | 200                                 |                    |
| has-header | Content-Type                        | qr/charset=UTF-8$/i |
