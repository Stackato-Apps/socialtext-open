* Fixture: Reports

| standard-test-setup |
| set | viewers_url | /data/workspaces/%%workspace%%/pages/foo/viewers |

Should be no activity for a new workspace.

| GET_json  | %%viewers_url%%  |
| code-is   | 200              |
| body-like | "totalResults":0 |

View a page:

| edit-page    | %%workspace%%      | Foo | Blah |
| GET          | /%%workspace%%/foo |     |      |
| code-is      | 200                |     |      |
| sleep        | 1                  |     |      |
| consume-logs |                    |     |      |

| GET_json  | %%viewers_url%%         |
| code-is   | 200                     |
| body-like | "totalResults":1        |
| body-like | "count":"1"             |
| body-like | "user_id":"%%user_id%%" |

Try getting a workspace we're not a member of.

| set              | ws2              | ws2-%%start_time%%                         |
| create-workspace | %%ws2%%          |                                            |
| set              | viewers_url2     | /data/workspaces/%%ws2%%/pages/foo/viewers |
| GET_json         | %%viewers_url2%% |                                            |
| code-is          | 403              |                                            |


But if we're a business admin we should be able to view any ws.

| set-business-admin | %%username%%     |
| GET_json           | %%viewers_url2%% |
| code-is            | 200              |
