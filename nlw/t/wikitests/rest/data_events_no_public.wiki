Test that event feeds don't contain events from public-read-only and
public-comment-only workspaces, except for my conversations eventswhere the
reader is part of the conversation


* Fixture: SocialRest

* create workspaces: pro (public read only) and pco (public comment only)
* create users: other, reader
* other and reader post in a conversation and individually (comment back and forht)
* confirm that reader gets no events, except in the conversation feed and only for those they are in conversation for
