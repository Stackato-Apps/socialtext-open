Workspaces should be allowed to begin with the word "challenge" (addresses Bug {bz: 3911})

Bug was that if a WS started with the word "challenge" then it was getting
caught by a regex meant for the Challenger and wasn't properly redirecting off
to the WS.

*NOTE:* this test is related to "challenge-redirect.wiki" but is for *mobile browsers*; if you add any new scenarios here please keep the other in sync!
