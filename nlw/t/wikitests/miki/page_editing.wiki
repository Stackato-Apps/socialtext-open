* Fixture: SocialRest

## Setup: In order to test editability of a lite page, we'll need to test with
## a workspace admin, a workspace member, and a simple authenticated user. We'll
## start by making the workspace public-read-only and checking out the presence
## of an Edit link. Once verified, we'll turn on locking for a particular page
## and test for an Edit link again. This tests out the fix for {bz: 3151}
