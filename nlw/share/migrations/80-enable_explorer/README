This is implemented for [Story: Explore is enabled after indexing].

Explorer is a major feature that needs to launch as smoothly as possible. With
that in mind, we should not be making the feature available to customers
before it builds up its database.

This migration will turn the explorer link off, then set up a monitoring job
to keep an eye on the required signals re-indexing. When the re-index
completes, we'll turn the link back on.
