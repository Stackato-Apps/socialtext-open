This migration will move update all account defaults for appliances.
Since these alterations have already taken place on our production
servers, we will skip it if that's where we're running.

This migration:

* Makes the skin for all accounts s3
* Adds the 'widgets' and 'dashboard' plugins to all accounts.
* Removes the skin for any workspaces that were set to s2; they
  can now rely on the account default.
