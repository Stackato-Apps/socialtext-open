A relationship field can be set to any user that shares an account with the
profile user. If a user is removed from an account, no check was done to
remove that user from any profile relationships where the two users no longer
share an account. This migration will delete any relationship records where
the two users do not share an account.

This is the data clean-up phase of {bz 5251}.
