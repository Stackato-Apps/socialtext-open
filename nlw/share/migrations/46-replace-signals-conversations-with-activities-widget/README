For [Story: User views all activities in single widget], this migration replaces
all Signals and Recent Conversations widgets with the new Activities widget.

For Signals widgets, the replaced Activities widget will be pre-configured to
"Signals only" mode.  For Recent Conversations widgets, the replace Activities
widget will simply use the "all events from everyone" default mode.
