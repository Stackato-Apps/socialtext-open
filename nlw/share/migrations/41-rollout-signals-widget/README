For [Story: Roll out Signals Widget], this migration pushes the signals widget
to all users' dashboards that *do not already have it installed*. Only users
in accounts that actually have signals enabled will see the widget.

This migration needs to make sure to only do this push *once* ever, no matter
how many times the script is run. The intent here is that some users didn't
get the signals widget when signals was rolled out due to a set of
circumstances that no longer exist - PM has decided the way to remedy this is
a one-time push.
