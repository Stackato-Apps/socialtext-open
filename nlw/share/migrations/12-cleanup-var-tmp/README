This is a migration for RT-27506.  htmldoc(1) creates lots of temp files in
/var/tmp.  We changed how htmldoc is invokved so it uses /tmp instead, but we
still need to cleanup its older temp files.  We can only safely do this
cleanup on Socialtext appliances.  Other release types will skip this
migration.

The pre-check attempts to see if we're on an appliance.  If we are the
migration continues, if we're not the migration is skipped.  Some other basic
sanity checks are done as well.

The migration does a find(1) / rm(1) of the htmldoc(1) temp files.  Care is
taken to not remove recently used temp files and to only delete tempfiles
matching the pattern used by htmldoc(1).

The post-check is a no-op.
