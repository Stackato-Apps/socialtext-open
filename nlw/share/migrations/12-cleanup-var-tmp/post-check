# Nothing to post-check.  We use find(1) / rm(1) to clean things up, and the
# obvious post-check would just do a find(1) again which wouldn't tell us
# anything.  If it failed the first time wouldn't it just fail again?
#
# If rm failed to remove files then that would be signaled by the migration
# failing, since rm checks for that itself.  

# So there's nothing to test here since the migration employs such low-level
# tools that tend to work if used right.  The only way to test if they're used
# to right is to test the migration by hand.
