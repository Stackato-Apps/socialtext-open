In this iteration, 2009-05-11, we made it possible for workspace admins
to lock pages on a workspace given that 1) the workspace was configured
to allow such and 2) the admin had the 'lock' permssion ( See
Socialtext::Permission for details ).

By default, we'd like to add the 'lock' permission to admins on all
existing workspaces.
