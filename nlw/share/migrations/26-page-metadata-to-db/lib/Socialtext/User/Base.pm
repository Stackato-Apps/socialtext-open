=head1 NAME

Socialtext::User::Base - Base class for User objects

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Socialtext::User::Base> implements a base class from which all User objects
are to be derived from.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item B<Socialtext::User::*-E<gt>new($data)>

Creates a new user object based on the provided C<$data> (which could be a HASH
or a HASH-REF of data).

=item B<user_id()>

Returns the ID for the user.

=item B<username()>

Returns the username for the user.

=item B<email_address()>

Returns the e-mail address for the user, in all lower-case.

=item B<first_name()>

Returns the first name for the user.

=item B<last_name()>

Returns the last name for the user.

=item B<password()>

Returns the encrypted password for this user.

=item B<driver_name()>

Returns the name of the driver used for the data store this user was found in.
e.g. "Default", "LDAP".

=item B<driver_id()>

Returns the unique ID for the instance of the data store this user was found
in.  This unique ID is internal and likely has no meaning to a user.
e.g. "0deadbeef0".

=item B<driver_key()>

Returns the fully qualified driver key ("name:id") of the driver instance for
the data store this user was found in.  This key is internal and likely has no
meaning to a user.  e.g. "LDAP:0deadbeef0".

=item B<to_hash()>

Returns a hash reference representation of the user, suitable for using with
JSON, YAML, etc.  B<WARNING:> The encrypted password is included in this hash,
and should usually be removed before passing the hash over the threshold.
