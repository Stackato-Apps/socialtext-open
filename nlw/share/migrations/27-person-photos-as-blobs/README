This migration will update data in the 'person' table to store people photos
in the database.

We will need to pull out the old data, update the table, insert the new
data, then pull in all the various photos from around the web.

--- Update Tue Nov 25 2008 ---
This migration has already run on all the machines that would have had the
interim code, so we have deprecated this migration.
