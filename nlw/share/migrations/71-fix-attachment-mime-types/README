Migration for [Task: Clear out bad mime-type files]

Mime-types for Office 2007 workspace attachments are currently cached on disk,
causing problems when we search for those attachments because what we have
cached does _not_ match what gets returned when we ask for a file's mime-type.
Rather than be picky and choosy about the files we fix, we'll scan _every_
file and clean up those who's cached mime-type does not match the output of
ST::MIME::Type.
