This is some cleanup work around our incomplete implementation of "deleted"
users. All users who are marked `all_users.is_deleted` need to be re-indexed
in solr so that they do not show up in search results. Since there is no way
do mark users as such in the UI yet, we don't have to worry about this stuff
getting out of sync.
