0.21  2006-05-31

- Added the "onSortRowCallback" constructor parameter.

- Fixed some bad example code in the docs. Reported by Kunz Ueli.


0.20  2006-05-23

- Add missing prereq, JSAN.

- Improved sorting so that if a column contains cells with identical
values, the widget falls back to sorting on another column for just
those cells. In previous versions, the sort order for identical cells
was basically random.

- Added the "secondarySortColumn" constructor parameter.

- Added "noInitialSort" constructor parameter based on a request by
Jochen Stenzel.

- If you created two widgets for the same table, this caused an error
in IE6. Now the code detects this and does the right thing, which
means skipping some code that just needs to run once per element,
rather than once per widget constructed.

- If a table had only one row (just a header), creating a widget for
it threw an error because the initial sort failed. Reported by Jochen
Stenzel.


0.15  2006-01-28

- IE fix: cannot set CSS class via setAttribute, so use className
property instead.

- Document class name changes for <tr> tags in table.


0.14  2006-01-27

- Add onClick attribute to generated <a> tags that resort columns in
order to make the browser not move the page when it is clicked on.


0.13  2006-01-26

- Also add class names to rows, "w-st-odd-row" and "w-st-even-row", to
allow for typical table styling of alternating background colors every
other row.


0.12  2006-01-26

- Currency and number sorting were broken in 0.11. Added more tests.


0.11  2006-01-26

- If two cells contained identical text data, the sorting went
haywire.

- Improved detection of column type by better handling of whitespace.

- Added detection for currency type.

- Handle empty cells properly when sorting.


0.10  2006-01-26
