* Fixture: SocialWidgets

This testset tests the Signals Only configuration: dashboard disabled, signals enabled, no wikis other than Help wikis.

In a dev env, it will delete all the standard wikis from a dev env and devnull1 member from help-en and help-adminguide.
In a VE, it will turn it into a microblogging appliance by executing `st-appliance-config set signals_only 1`

Since it will delete all wikis, the plan server and plan workspace must be in a different running environment.

To use this testset:

`export SELENIUM_PLAN_SERVER=http://$PLAN_SERVER:$PLAN_PORT`

dev env: `cdcur; source nlw/dev-bin/sotc`
appliance: `cd; source /usr/share/stconfig/stbin/qa/appliance/asotc`

for example:

.pre
sudo su - qa1 (Signals Only dev env is user qa1 dev env, topaz:22201.  It will be wrecked.)
export SELENIUM_PLAN_SERVER=http://topaz.socialtext.net:22004 (plan server and workspace is from topaz:22004)
cdcur
source nlw/dev-bin/sotc
.pre

sotc will `run-wiki-tests --plan-page signals_only_testcases` using the plan server and workspace, thus executing this page:

NOTE: each of these test must manage its own plugin enables/disables, logins and logouts independently so order is not significant
