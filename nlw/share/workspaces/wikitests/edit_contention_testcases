Opening a page for editing, then going to it in Selenium, cancels the edit contention. So we use three separate tests, connected by a common page called `Special Edit Contention Page`.

I tried to hook these tests together using %%start_time%% and other tricks to pass a page title between them, but failed. So the page title is always `Special Edit Contention Page`.

opens the page for editing

* [Test Case: Edit Contention Setup]

tests the edit contention UI

* [Test Case: Edit Contention Execute]

purges the page

* [Test Case: Edit Contention Reset]
