| *Comment* | Test Case: Setup Signals Only |

* Fixture: SocialWidgets

Setup Signals Only is intended to be called from [Signals Only Testcases]

This testcase mimics the Signals Only configuration in a dev env: dashboard disabled, signals enabled, no wikis other than Help wikis.

It will delete all the standard wikis from a dev env and remove devnull1 membership from help-en and help-adminguide
Since it will delete all wikis, the plan server and plan workspace must be in a different running environment.

If running on a VE instead of a dev env, it will execute:
`st-appliance-config set signals_only 1`
to actually set up microblogging. It still expects the plan server to be elsewhere - a dev env will work just fine.
