* Fixture: SocialWidgets

These testcases work for an LDAP user but not for a default user.
These testcases REQUIRE that LDAP be enabled.
Any LDAP user specific testcases should go here.

Every test should override the passed in values as follows:

set | username | devnullx |
set | email | devnullx@socialtext.com |
set | password | ldapd3v |
set | email_esc | devnullx\@socialtext.com |

LDAP test cases must explicitly use the above ldap username, email, and pwd so LDAP Testcases can be called from tests where a Default user is logged in.
