create a user that lexically precedes the logged in user by creating a user that begins with start_time
However, don't use %%email%% in that username because that permanently creates another user name in the user DB that
contains %%email%% as a substring and that messes up other tests like Test Case: Email

| *Comment* | Test Case: Watchlist verify revision by different user |  |

| set | s_user | %%start_time%%@%%start_time%%.socialtext.net |

| st-admin | add-member --email %%s_user%% --workspace %%workspace%% |  |
| st-admin | update-page --email %%s_user%% --workspace %%workspace%% --page "BBB %%start_time%%" < %%wikitest_client_files%%wikitest.txt | The "BBB %%start_time%%" page has been updated. |

^ DONE_TESTING

^ Remaining TODO:

| Figure out a way to check which element of a dropdown menu is currently selected, text_like does not do this | Check dropdown menu functionality in Settings->Watchlist |  |
| Change notification to every minute, then edit a page in the watchlist | notification is saved as Every Minute |  |
| Wait a few minutes, then read email | watchlist notification message received |  |
| In the email, click through to change the preference for notification frequency | arrive at correct UI page |  |
| if preference in watchlist email is set to display name, links, edited by and edited date, the email is displayed correctly according to the preference | verify correct email content |  |
| if preference in watchlist email is set to display page title and link only, the email is displayed correctly | change preference, edit a watched page, receive email, verify correct email content |  |
| clicking on a page link in the watchlist email takes you to the correct page |  |  |
| when a page is removed from the watchlist, it is removed from email | remove a page from the watchlist, edit a watched page, receive email, verify that removed page is not present |  |
| when a page is removed from watch list, it is removed from rss | click RSS icon for watchlist; examine RSS content |  |
