Saving profile changes causes selenium top-level to disappear. Until we get that fixed, we split testing into two pieces that will run in two different instantiations of a Selenium browser. The first one modifies the profile, the second one verifies the modifications. They have to be run as a pair - Edit Profile fills in the profile and is forced to exit immediately after saving the profile, and Verify Profile checks it.

I tried to hook these tests together using %%start_time%% and other tricks to pass a username between them, but failed. So the username is always `profile.editor@ken.socialtext.net`
