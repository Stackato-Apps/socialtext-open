* HighPermissions
This test will NOT RUN IN any IE because IE presents feed pages as XML, not HTML, and Se simply can't see non-HTML pages.

Selenium seems to need to run multi-window to run this test successfully, because the test
uses "location_like" to determine if the RSS feed window opened

First, delete a page that contains a search term so you can test RSS feeds for for deleted pages
Then, find an instance of each of the RSS icons and click it to see if you get a feed page
It seems that Selenium cannot analyze the content of feed pages because they are not HTML pages.
