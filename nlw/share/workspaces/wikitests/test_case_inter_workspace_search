| *Comment* | Test Case: Inter Workspace Search |  |

| *Comment* | This test relies on the presence of test-data and deliberately overwrites fixed workspace names so subsequent runs will work with `workspaces:*` |  |

| *Comment* | Test Case: Inter Workspace Search Clone test-data twice so we don't have to deal with ceq issues |  |

| st-admin | delete-workspace --workspace test-data2 --no-export |  |

| st-admin | set-workspace-config --workspace test-data2 title test-data2 | The workspace config for test-data2 has been updated. |
