| *Comment* | Starting Test Case: Preview Format |  |
| *Comment* | now contains only tests for RT 27049 |  |
| *Comment* | the idea is to add 3 headers with a TOC widget in the middle of the page |  |
| *Comment* | in Preview mode, the TOC widget should render the headers as links |  |


| *Comment* | create a page from file, because we can't type newlines with type_ok |  |
| st-admin | update-page --workspace %%workspace%% --email %%email%% --page "Edit This Page TOC %%start_time%%" < %%wikitest_client_files%%wikitest_toc.txt | The "Edit This Page TOC %%start_time%%" page has been created. |

| open_ok | /%%workspace%%/index.cgi?Edit This Page TOC %%start_time%% |  |
| click_ok | st-edit-button-link |  |
| wait_for_text_present_ok | Editing: | 30000 |
| wait_for_element_visible_ok | link=Wiki Text | 30000 |
