Addresses Bugs {bz: 3708} and {bz: 3717} , where we saw the CP looking up Users by "username" instead of "user_id".

When we had Users that had an _all numeric_ username, that *could* conflict with the user_id of another User in the system, and the CP would inadvertently display data for or perform operations against the wrong User.
