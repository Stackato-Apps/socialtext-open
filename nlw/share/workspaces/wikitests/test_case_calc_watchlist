^ DONE_TESTING

^ Remaining todo:

| Figure out a way to check which element of a dropdown menu is currently selected, text_like does not do this | Check dropdown menu functionality in Settings->Watchlist |  |
| Change notification to every minute, then edit a page in the watchlist | notification is saved as Every Minute |  |
| Wait a few minutes, then read email | watchlist notification message received |  |
| In the email, click through to change the preference for notification frequency | arrive at correct UI page |  |
| if preference in watchlist email is set to display name, links, edited by and edited date, the email is displayed correctly according to the preference | verify correct email content |  |
| if preference in watchlist email is set to display page title and link only, the email is displayed correctly | change preference, edit a watched page, receive email, verify correct email content |  |
| clicking on a page link in the watchlist email takes you to the correct page |  |  |
| when a page is removed from the watchlist, it is removed from email | remove a page from the watchlist, edit a watched page, receive email, verify that removed page is not present |  |
| when a page is removed from watch list, it is removed from rss | click RSS icon for watchlist; examine RSS content |  |
