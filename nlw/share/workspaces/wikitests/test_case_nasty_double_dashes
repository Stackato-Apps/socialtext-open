| *Comment* | Test Case: Nasty Double Dashes | KNOWN NASTY |

Link text for a widget that contains a double dash used to blow up the editor.
e.g. `{Hello -- World}{link: help [Socialtext Documentation]}`
Set test_string to such a string, then make a widget with that as the link text, then try to blow it up.

| set | test_string | `Hello -- World %%start_time%%` |

| open_ok | /%%workspace%%/index.cgi?action=new_page |  |
| wait_for_element_visible_ok | link=Wiki Text | 30000 |
| click_ok | link=Wiki Text |  |
| wait_for_element_visible_ok | st-newpage-pagename-edit | 30000 |
| wait_for_element_visible_ok | wikiwyg_wikitext_textarea | 30000 |
| type_ok | st-newpage-pagename-edit | Nasty Double Dashes %%start_time%% |

| *Comment* | put the nasty string in as widget link text |  |
| type_ok | wikiwyg_wikitext_textarea | `"%%test_string%%"{link: help [Socialtext Documentation]}` |
| click_ok | link=Rich Text |  |

The only way to tell things went wrong was to know that the final result should be on a line by itself, matching `/^\s*%%test_string_escaped%%$/m`

| *Comment* | The last line of the page should contain only %%test_string%% |  |
| text_like | contentContainer | %%test_string%% |
| text_unlike | contentContainer | `<!-- wiki:` |

^ DONE_TESTING

This is what is printed out by the tester when you force the test to fail so you can see the string it is matching against

.pre
#                   'Canonical Test Data Set
#  Hello -- World 1186950521 title
#  Hello -- World 1186950521<!-- wiki: Hello -- World 1186950521'

.pre

Note that the test string (Hello -- World 1186950521) appears at both the beginning and the end of the third line, with garbage in between.
And the right answer would just have the text string on a line by itself on the third line. Check for the raw HTML explicitly.
