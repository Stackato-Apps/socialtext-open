| *Comment* | Test Case: Nasty Double Dashes | KNOWN NASTY |  |  |

Link text for a widget that contains a double dash used to blow up the editor.
e.g. `{Hello -- World} {link: help [Socialtext Documentation]}`
Set test_string to such a string, then make a widget with that as the link text, then try to blow it up.

| set | test_string | `Hello -- World %%start_time%%` |  |  |

| *Comment* | put the nasty string in as widget link text |  |  |  |

| call | [st-edit-fill-page] | ws=%%workspace%% | title=Nasty Double Dashes %%start_time%% | `content="%%test_string%%"{link: help [Socialtext Documentation]}` |

| click_ok | //a[contains(@class,"cke_button_wysiwyg")] |  |
| pause | 15000 | no choice but to pause until Simple interface appears |
| wait_for_element_visible_ok | st-save-button-link | 30000 |
| st-page-save |  |  |

The only way to tell things went wrong was to know that the final result should be on a line by itself, matching `/^\s*%%test_string_escaped%%$/m`

| *Comment* | The last line of the page should contain only %%test_string%% |  |
| text_like | content | %%test_string%% |
| text_unlike | content | `<!-- wiki:` |

^ DONE_TESTING
This is what is printed out by the tester when you force the test to fail so you can see the string it is matching against

.pre
#                   'Canonical Test Data Set
#  Hello -- World 1186950521 title
#  Hello -- World 1186950521<!-- wiki: Hello -- World 1186950521'

.pre

Note that the test string (Hello -- World 1186950521) appears at both the beginning and the end of the third line, with garbage in between.
And the right answer would just have the text string on a line by itself on the third line. Check for the raw HTML explicitly.
