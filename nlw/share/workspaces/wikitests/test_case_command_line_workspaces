This doesn't work. Why?
st-admin import-workspace--tarball /tmp/%%target_workspace%%.1.tar.gz --name %%target_workspace%%-2

the `--dir` option is not being tested. Testing it would require specifying a directory (other than /tmp) to save the workspace too. I don't know of another cross-platform area. Another approach would be to create a /tmp/foo directory for the test, through a `mkdir` or `run` command.
