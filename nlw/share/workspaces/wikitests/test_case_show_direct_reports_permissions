| *Comment* | Test Case: Show Direct Reports |

* Fixture: SocialWidgets
skip.ie because update-profile causes Se to exit in IE

Here's the basic setup:

Manager will belong to accountM
Users 01 will belong to account One
Users 02 will belong to account Two
User 03 will belong to account Three
User 04 will belong to account tmp
User 05 will belong to account tmp

We will all create accounts Joiner1 and Joiner2
and workspaces joiner1 and joiner2 in those accounts
Manager will belong to both workspaces
User 01 will belong to both workspaces
User 02 will belong to joiner1
User 03 will belong to joiner2
User 04 will belong to joiner1
User 05 will belong to joiner2

Therefore ...

User02 will see Manager has user 01, user02 and user04 as direct reports ONLY (does not see 03 or 05)
User02 will see user01, user04 as peers (does not see 03, 05)
User04 will see Manager has user01, User02, User04, User05 (because 04 and 05 share account tmp) as direct report (Not user03)
Manager see's 'em all
