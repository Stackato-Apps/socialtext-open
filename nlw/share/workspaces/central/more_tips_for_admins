*1. Create an attractive default Dashboard for your company*

When your colleagues log in to Socialtext for the first time, you want them to enter an experience which reflects your company's unique business, content, and collaboration needs

* Click on "Administer Dashboards" button in the upper right-hand corner.
* Add, remove, position, configure, and lock widgets to build the default Dashboard experience. Then click Save.
* Typical default Dashboards include company news, links to key resources, RSS feeds, most active people/content, Outlook calendar/email, people tags.
* New users will see your default Dashboard when they first log in, with an option to personalize anything you haven't locked down.

*2. Use the Central workspace for company-wide business*

Set up Socialtext as a company-wide place for announcements, resources, conversations, and collaboration.

* Every account comes pre-loaded with a "Central" workspace. All members of the account have access to this Central workspace, and it's a great place for company-wide content, discussion, and collaboration.
* Use the Central workspace for all "Intranet-style" content: announcements, news, company-wide collateral, benefits information, idea submissions, shared tools, etc.
* Lock down the pages you want to manage centrally. Only workspace administrators can change locked pages.

*3. Create private groups for confidential business*

Some collaboration must be kept confidential (e.g., leadership disucssions, HR, Finance, confidential strategy discussions, M&A activity, press releases in progress, etc.). Private groups support these confidential interactions.

* Create private groups by going to Groups-->Create Group-->Private Group in the main navigation at the top of every page
* Private groups are visible and accessible only to colleagues who have been invited in. They are completely invisible to non-members.
* Adding a workspace to a private group enables the members to collaborate on shared documentation, meeting notes, file attachments, etc.

*4. Create self-join groups for departments and interest areas*

For topic-based or group-based collaboration which is not confidential but doesn't involve the whole company, create self-join groups (e.g., photographers, Sales & Marketing, Six Sigma blackbelts, Londoners, etc.)

* Go to Groups-->Create Group-->Self-join Group in the main navigation at the top of every page.
* Self-join groups are visible to everyone by going to Groups-->Group Directory. However, your colleagues will see updates from a group only if they choose to join that group.
* Adding a workspace to a self-join group enables the members to collaborate on shared documentation, meeting notes, file attachments, etc.

*5. Collaborate with customers, partners, and other external parties*

In addition to internal collaboration, Socialtext can help you collaborate securely with customers, channel partners, suppliers, and other external stakeholders.

* To create an external business community, first create a new account (yourURL/control)-->Accounts-->Create new account. This ensures that external stakeholders do not have access to internal content.
* Create a default Dashboard and Central Worksapce for your external account (see Steps 1-2 above).
* To manage multiple customer/partner communities confidentially, create a separate account for each different customer/partner.

*6. Questions on how to do things?*
