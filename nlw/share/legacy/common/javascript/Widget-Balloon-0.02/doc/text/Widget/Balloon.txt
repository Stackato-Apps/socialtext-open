NAME

    Widget.Balloon - Generate pop-up balloons above objects as a hint.

SYNOPSIS

      <img id="img_one" src="foo.jpg" />
      <script type="text/javascript">
         new Widget.Balloon({
           elementId: "img_one",
           innerHTML: "<h1>Balloon A</h1><p>Lorem Ipsum</p>"
         })
      </script>

DESCRIPTION

    This library provides a ballon widget that could possibly be used to
    provide user hint, or some fancy in-place editing area. The balloon is
    shown when user's mouse is over the reference object, which could be an
    image or a div element. The content of the balloon is given in HTML.
    When user moves the mouse, the balloon will follow the mouse, and when
    user clicks the reference object, the balloon will freeze on current
    position. Clicking on the reference object again will release it.
    Clicking on the balloon will highlight it, clicking it again will
    cancel the highlight.

METHODS

    Here is the API of Widget.Balloon object.

    new({elementId: id, element: e, innerHTML: html })

      The constructor takes one argument, which is a hash with three
      possible keys: element, elementId, and innerHTML. The value to
      'element' is the reference object, which you usually obtain by
      calling getElementById(). Alternatively, you could give the
      constructor the element's ID. If the value of innerHTML is given, the
      constructor calls setInnerHTML() automatically. If not, you could set
      the content of balloon by calling setInnerHTML() method manually.

      Balloons' boundary are checked so that it always resides inside
      browser window.

    setInnerHTML(html)

      This method sets the innerHTML property of balloon.
