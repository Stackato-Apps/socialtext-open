- Added DOM.Ready.onDOMDone(). See the docs for this and for
onIdReady() for reasons why this is useful. Added a test for this,
"done.t.html" but it is not run with the others tests via index.html,
as it does not work when the run via a frame.

- BUG: If the timer fired before the DOM was ready, then callbacks
would never be executed.

- You can now set the timer interval via DOM.Ready.timerInterval.

- Default timer interval is now 50 milliseconds instead of 250.

- You can explicitly tell DOM.Ready to run all callbacks which are
ready by calling DOM.Ready.runCallbacks().


0.11  2005-08-27

- If used along with something that extended object (like prototype),
then attempting to run id-based callbacks caused an error.

- Initial release
