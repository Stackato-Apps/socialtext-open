Widget.Lightbox

Widget.Lightbox is an objective re-implementation of Lightbox JS
(http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/). It has several
nice features:

* Requires no extra image files
* Requires no extra CSS files and rules
* Optionally supports script.aculo.us effects library.
* Optionally supports JSAN effects library.
* Works on IE, Firefox, and Safari.

It's loaddable by JSAN, but not necessary. You can install this
library following standard JSAN distribution installation.
