We like to list things. The top reasons why:

# You can itemize your things
# Ideas are chunked for easy consumption
# You don’t have to write complete

Sometimes, we just want a grocery list:

* Milk
* Bread
* Spirulina

Other times, we want a funky outline:

* Rome
## Wasn’t built in a day
## Render unto Caesar
## Pizza not invented here
* Paris
** The one in Texas
** Harry Dean Stanton at his best
** Dry in the summer
* Bjork
** A country unto herself
*** The best part of Iceland
