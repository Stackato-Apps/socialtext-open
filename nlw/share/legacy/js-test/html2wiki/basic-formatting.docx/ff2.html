<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><i style="">Mind!</i></b><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don’t mean to
say that I know, <s>of my own knowledge</s>, what is particularly dead about a
door-nail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I might have been inclined,
myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the
trade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the <br>
wisdom <br>
of <br>
our <br>
ancestors <br>
is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the
Country’s done for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">You will <b style="">therefore</b> permit me to repeat, <b style=""><i style="">emphatically</i></b>, that Marley was as <i style="">dead as a door-nail</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Scrooge knew he was dead?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of course he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could it be
otherwise?<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Scrooge and he were partners for I
don’t know how many years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">Scrooge was his <b style="">sole <i style="">executor</i></b>,
his <b style="">sole <i style="">administrator</i></b>, his <b style="">sole <i style="">assign</i></b>, his <b style="">sole <i style="">residuary legatee</i></b>,
his <b style="">sole <i style="">friend</i></b>, and <b style="">sole <i style="">mourner</i></b>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">And even Scrooge was not so
dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of
business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnized it with an undoubted
bargain.</p>
