*MARLEY* was _dead_: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of this burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner.

*_Mind!_* I don’t mean to say that I know, -of my own knowledge-, what is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the
wisdom
of
our
ancestors

> You will *therefore* permit me to repeat, *_emphatically_*, that Marley was as _dead as a door-nail_.

Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?

> Scrooge and he were partners for I don’t know how many years.
>> Scrooge was his *sole _executor_*, his *sole _administrator_*, his *sole _assign_*, his *sole _residuary legatee_*, his *sole _friend_*, and *sole _mourner_*.
> And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnized it with an undoubted bargain.
